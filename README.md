## Introduction ##

Purpose of this talk: stop every langages trolls on the Internet :)

_style_ definition: this is an aggregation of constraints.

A style should be contextualized from an historical point of vue: is IT progress?

Note that we will run integration test during all session.

Our exemple: word frequency

## First ##

monolithic <- good problem introduction and first implementation

## Second ##

object oriented = things <- object oriented and then error handling (cf adversity)

## Third ##

functional = candy factory = pipeline = function composition

**Question**: do we go back to monolithic in order to refactor easier?

## Four ##

code golf <- one liner just for fun

## Conclusion ##

Know constraints of your frameworks/langages/fonctionnal requirements because it yields to a style

When one master many styles then we can switch between any easier
